# Assembly x86_64 Book

The best way to teach something is to do it while you learn it. Once you have all the information, it is hard to know what to know what to teach and how.

So, that is how this book is started.

I embark on a journy of learning x86_64 assembly and I want to share my findings for the next person to find and use.

This might not be laid in the correct order and it is the way I learn, but once I reach the end, I can always restructure and clean up.
